## Summary

I am an entrepreneur, [ex-Army Captain](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina/status/293833974575415298) and self-taught developer. You can usually find me coffee in-hand, building [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org), or working the family business. If I'm not coding or closing a sale, I'm most likely hanging with my [daughters](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina/status/478276357663629312), [wife](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina/status/495738797565284353), or enjoying [Portland's food trucks](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina/status/698136223856988160).

## Work Experience

# Founder & Executive Director

*[Operation Code](http://operationcode.org)* - Portland, Oregon, Aug 2014 to Present

Eighteen months after exiting active-duty and determined to learn to code and build my dream web application using my education benefits earned after a decade in uniform, I created a website to petition our U.S. Congress to expand the New GI Bill to include code schools. What became a small open source project and petition has [evolved](https://operationcode.org/press) over time to include, software mentorship, scholarships, web apprenticeship, employer services and advocacy for America's men and women who've served in uniform to learn to code and fill the nation's technical talent shortage. Learn more on our [blog](https://medium.com/operation-code), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/operation_code) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/operationcode.org).

## Co-Founder

*[BilingualHire](http://bilingualhire.co) - Portland, Oregon, Apr 2014 to Present*

Tired of waiting for a co-founder to build out the product, I enrolled in [One Month Rails on Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/technology/Teach-Yourself-to-Code-One-Month-Rails/1289605848/projects/983) and learned the basics of Ruby on Rails. In 2014, I took another stab after some Thinkful coursework and flushed out our Minimal Viable Product (MVP), a job posting service allowing anyone to post a bilingual job opportunity, and gained traction, users and important customer feedback. In early 2016, rubyist and friend, [Chris Hough](https://github.com/chrishough/my-resume) joined as our first Ruby on Rails engineer to integrate this feedback and we re-launched the web application on May 30, 2016.

# Plans, Training & Operations Officer (S-2/3 OIC), Public Affairs & Protocol Officer

*[Joint Personal Effects Depot](http://www.army.mil/article/104747/) - Dover AFB, Delaware,
Feb 2011 to Feb 2013*

Mobilized as a 1st Lieutenant and promoted to Captain upon arrival to support the transition of Joint Personal Effects Depot [transition](http://www.dover.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123252347) relocated  Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland to [Dover Air Force Base, Delaware](https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidcmolina/albums/72157626376244957). As the S-2/3 OIC, I was the lead project officer on the [Ribbon Cutting Ceremony](https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidcmolina/albums/72157626431083423) that hosted hundreds of VIP, senior military and civilian leaders. During 24 months on active-duty in a battalion staff role, I authored Standard Operating Procedures for new Dover process, established public affairs/protocol procedures and coordinating all unit visits in conjunction with Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations (AFMAO)/Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES) and Wing, from flag officers to Members of Congress. Launched SharePoint intranet and trained department personnel on HTML/maintenance, launched the command's external website, jped.mil, using DotNetNuke, and Army Liaison to the Secretary of the Army and Sergeant Major of the Army during President Obama's visit in August 2011. I was humbled to be part of such an [rewarding mission](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina/status/284748039019712512).

# Co-Founder & Business Development

*[NestNote](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nestnote#/entity) - New York City (remote), Jul 2012 to Oct 2012*

I worked with co-founder & developer, [Vitaliy Dikker](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina/status/216910406667608065), who I met at [AngelHack](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina/status/217020769396469760) on social note taking app, [NestNote](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina/status/220897990712377344), which aimed to help people on Twitter capture reminders, to-do's, notes, and store them privately for later viewing. Organic to Twitter, NestNote converted hashtags into "digital files" and tweets into reminders and notes. Users could use NestNote to create reminders and notes by simply adding a #hashtag (filename) and the user-handle @nestnote to the tweet and NestNote did the rest. Example: `#books Read Good to Great @nestnote`

We chose to shut it down after not getting the traction we expected.

# Co-Founder & Managing Partner

*BilingualHire Staffing Services - Portland, Oregon, June 2009 to Feb 2011*
