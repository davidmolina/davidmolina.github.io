## Summary

My work has consistently centered on institutions — how they operate, how they evolve, and how they serve people.

I am an entrepreneur, veteran, and systems-builder who has spent the past two decades operating across military service, public policy, federal contracting, nonprofit leadership, and advisory work in regulated industries. I began my career in uniform, serving over a decade in the United States Army as both an enlisted soldier and commissioned officer. Those years instilled in me a deep respect for disciplined execution, institutional documentation, and mission-focused leadership.

After transitioning from active duty, I staffed the Oregon House Committee on Veterans & Emergency Services, where I learned firsthand how legislation moves from intent to statute to implementation. That experience reinforced an insight that has shaped the rest of my career: policy and operations are inseparable. Institutions only function well when strategy, governance, and execution are aligned.

Since then, I have founded companies, built systems, advised business owners, authored enterprise documentation, and led multi-stakeholder initiatives in complex environments. Today, my work focuses on helping business owners and regulated operators modernize their governance systems, quantify risk, and prepare for long-term scalability or exit. Increasingly, this includes leveraging AI-assisted workflows to improve documentation, compliance visibility, and operational clarity.

I grew up in Mount Vernon, Washington — a small farming community 60 miles north of Seattle — and earned a B.A. in Political Science and an Army ROTC commission from Oregon State University. My career continues to evolve at the intersection of institutions, technology, and public service.

### Experience
**Principal**, [Molinas Systems Consulting](https://molinas.consulting/) 
| 2022 – Present

Advises regulated operators on operational strategy, governance architecture, and execution discipline across construction, agriculture, and service-based enterprises. Directed 100+ transformation engagements focused on reducing ambiguity, formalizing decision-making structures, and modernizing workflow systems through structured documentation, automation where appropriate, and reproducible operating models.

Developed a standardized estimating and cost-governance framework formalizing risk buffers (waste/overage), insurance and bond allocation, overhead attribution, and execution velocity metrics into executive dashboards. Implemented across 150+ contractors, driving ~33% average profit improvement and converting margin volatility into measurable performance control. Designed structured lead-to-dispatch routing systems for distributed 1099 contractor networks, reducing manual scheduling intervention by ~90% and accelerating response time from hours to minutes. Leveraged automation and scripted tooling, including Python-based metadata normalization, to streamline document-intensive processes and improve reproducibility across production environments.

**Business Operator**, Family Office 
| 2024 – 2025

Directed enterprise platform rollout across a $600–$800M family office multifamily portfolio spanning three western states and 50+ employees. Led cross-functional coordination across operations, finance, leasing, maintenance, and vendor stakeholders to standardize workflows and modernize property management systems. Implemented structured documentation protocols and accountability frameworks to improve SLA visibility and portfolio-wide execution consistency.

Standardized contractor governance across 79+ vendors, formalizing maintenance frameworks and deploying executive dashboards tracking cost forecasts, response velocity, and vendor performance. Reduced administrative overhead by 12–16 hours weekly while improving executive decision visibility and enabling leadership to reallocate operational capacity toward acquisition growth.

**Commercial Real Estate Advisory**, eXp Commercial 
| 2023–2025

Engaged with investors and owner-operators on commercial asset valuation, exit planning, and transaction readiness. Completed formal brokerage training at Rockwell Real Estate School and advanced coursework in valuation and succession planning methodologies.

Provided advisory support on pricing strategy, capital positioning, and market exposure, strengthening fluency in commercial underwriting considerations, investor engagement, and portfolio transition planning.

**Government Affairs Counselor**, [Fuerza Labor](https://www.fuerzalabor.com/) 
| 2022 – Present

Provide strategic analysis on federal immigration policy, consular operations, and regulatory developments affecting agricultural labor mobility and U.S. food system stability. Developed a structured monitoring and impact-assessment framework translating congressional action and executive branch policy shifts into coordinated implementation guidance for regulated stakeholders operating across U.S.–Mexico corridors. Engaged legal, operational, and cross-border partners to anticipate regulatory friction, mitigate workforce disruption, and preserve seasonal production continuity within an interdependent North American food economy.

Work centers on the intersection of institutional capacity, bilateral coordination, and long-term economic resilience.

**Founder & Project Executive**, [Molinas Construction Company](https://www.molinas.co/) | 2015 - 2022

I founded Molinas Construction Company out of my garage with a focus on federal contracting and infrastructure support. Over time, we scaled into a dedicated, decentralized team serving U.S. federal agencies and commercial clients.

Our work required navigating procurement frameworks, compliance requirements, subcontractor ecosystems, and cost governance systems. I developed structured estimating methodologies and margin controls to bring financial visibility and discipline to project execution. These systems later became formalized into advisory frameworks adopted by other contractors seeking to stabilize profitability and improve operational maturity.

Beyond project delivery, I prioritized workforce diversification — actively recruiting and mentoring veterans, women, Latina/os, immigrants, and young people into the skilled trades. The company became not just a contracting vehicle, but a platform for institutional inclusion and professional development.

While much of my time was spent in pre-construction meetings, estimating, subcontractor coordination, and field visits, I was equally focused on building internal systems that allowed the organization to scale responsibly. After several years of sustained growth, I stepped aside from day-to-day operations to prioritize personal health and long-term sustainability, ensuring the company’s systems were positioned to continue operating with discipline and continuity.

**Founder & Executive Director**, [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org/)
| 2014 - 2018

Operation Code began as a small website I built after discovering that the Post-9/11 GI Bill did not cover modern coding bootcamps. At the time, zero code schools in the country accepted GI Bill funding due to regulatory barriers.

Rather than accept the status quo, I began attending Ruby on Rails meetups while still on active duty, teaching myself web development and engaging the broader technology community. I launched operationcode.org to petition Congress to modernize GI Bill eligibility requirements for nontraditional technical education.

What began as a single website grew into a globally distributed nonprofit operating across 19 time zones. We built a remote-first operating model using Slack as our central coordination platform. Volunteers, mentors, veterans, and software engineers collaborated in real time to build talent pipelines and navigate regulatory processes.

Over time, more than 30 code schools across 20 states became GI Bill eligible. Service members gained access to structured mentorship, and national advocacy efforts contributed to securing $75 million in federal funding over five years through the [VET TEC Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1989).

The organization demonstrated that small, well-coordinated, decentralized teams can influence national policy and unlock institutional change when execution and mission alignment are clear.

After four years, I stepped down to allow new leadership to continue scaling the organization’s impact.

**Co-Founder & CTO**, [BilingualHire](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bilingualhire) 
| 2013 - 2015

Rather than wait for a technical co-founder, I enrolled in One Month Rails and later completed front-end coursework through Thinkful to build the initial MVP of a bilingual job-posting platform. The product enabled employers to post bilingual opportunities and connect with Spanish-English talent.

In 2016, a Ruby on Rails engineer joined to integrate user feedback and relaunch the application. Despite early traction, we were unable to secure seed funding to scale the product and ultimately shifted focus to other ventures. The platform later transitioned under ThinkMujer, a Latina-owned education consultancy.

| 2012

Co-founded a social note-taking application designed to convert Twitter hashtags into private digital files and reminders. Led communications strategy, press outreach, and user acquisition efforts. Although the product did not gain sustained traction, the experience accelerated my transition into software development and startup execution.

In this role, I wrote press releases and wrote copy, pitched bloggers and influencers to try out NestNote. Unfortunately, NestNote didn't get the traction we expected, but I got hooked on building a startup and began my transition to learn to code, apply to code school, and exit active-duty.

| 2005 - 2006

Selected as Aide-de-Camp to the Assistant Division Commander (Operations), coordinating executive scheduling, travel, protocol, and cross-functional alignment across a multi-state command.
