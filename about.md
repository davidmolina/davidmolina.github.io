### About

David Molina is an entrepreneur, public servant, and institutional strategist whose work has consistently centered on strengthening systems that serve people.

Over two decades, his career has moved across military service, legislative advisory, federal contracting, nonprofit leadership, and governance-focused advisory work. While the arenas have varied, the unifying thread has remained constant: translating mission into execution and building durable institutions capable of long-term impact.

### Public Service & Institutional Leadership

David first enlisted in the United States Army in 2000 and later earned an Officer Commission in Infantry through Army ROTC at Oregon State University. He served over a decade in uniform, rising to the rank of Captain.

Among his assignments was service at the [Joint Personal Effects Depot (JPED)](https://www.dover.af.mil/News/Article/229696/dover-afb-welcomes-jped/), a mission responsible for the dignified collection and return of personal effects belonging to Fallen and Wounded Service Members. During a 24-month wartime mobilization at Dover Air Force Base, he served as Plans, Training & Operations Officer and Public Affairs & Protocol Officer in a joint, multi-service wartime environment.

In this capacity, he modernized Standard Operating Procedures, co-authored the Center for Army Lessons Learned JPED Handbook, implemented cross-training certifications, launched internal and external digital platforms, and coordinated senior-level visits involving general officers, Pentagon leadership, and Members of Congress. During President Barack Obama’s visit to Dover in 2011, he served as Army Liaison to the Secretary of the Army and Sergeant Major of the Army.

Earlier in his career, he served as Aide-de-Camp to senior Army leadership, gaining early exposure to executive coordination, strategic planning, and institutional stewardship.

Following his first active duty assignment, David staffed the [Oregon House Committee on Veterans & Emergency Services](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/committees/hvet), where he observed firsthand how legislation becomes law and how policy priorities are translated into operational realities. In his early 20s, he was appointed by the Governor to the [Oregon Commission on Hispanic Affairs](https://www.oregon.gov/oac/ocha/Pages/index.aspx), serving as Vice Chair and organizing public forums on civil rights, healthcare disparities, and workforce access.

These experiences shaped his understanding that strong institutions require disciplined systems, cross-sector collaboration, and accountability to the communities they serve.

### Systems, Technology & Institutional Modernization

In recent years, David has focused on designing AI-first governance and workflow architectures within regulated and capital-intensive environments. His advisory work has included modernizing operational platforms inside multi-state portfolios and developing structured documentation architectures that improve accountability, risk visibility, and institutional continuity.

Rather than viewing automation as a replacement for human judgment, he approaches AI as an instrument for institutional clarity — strengthening decision-making processes, standardizing knowledge systems, and improving reproducibility in complex organizations.

This work reflects a broader interest in how emerging technologies intersect with governance, policy, and long-term stewardship.

### Entrepreneurship & Federal Contracting

In 2015, David founded Molinas Construction Company, a federal contracting firm serving government agencies and commercial clients. What began in a garage evolved into a decentralized organization operating within federal procurement frameworks, compliance environments, and complex infrastructure projects.

Beyond contract execution, he built structured cost governance systems and margin controls to ensure operational discipline. The company prioritized workforce development, recruiting veterans, Latina/os, immigrants, and young people into the skilled trades and advancing their careers in traditionally underrepresented sectors.

After leading the company through sustained growth, David transitioned from day-to-day operations to focus on advisory work and long-term strategic initiatives.

### Civic Technology & Institutional Reform

In 2014, recognizing that the Post-9/11 GI Bill did not cover modern coding bootcamps, David founded [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/) — an open-source project that evolved into a nationally recognized 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

Operation Code built the nation’s first large-scale veteran-focused software mentorship network and worked with policymakers and educational institutions to modernize eligibility pathways for technical training. Over time, more than thirty coding schools across twenty states became GI Bill eligible, and advocacy efforts contributed to securing $75 million in federal funding through the [VET TEC Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1669/text) to expand access to technical education for veterans.

The organization operated as a distributed, remote-first team spanning 19 time zones — demonstrating that disciplined coordination, credible advocacy, and coalition building can influence federal policy.

David stepped down after several years of leadership to allow the organization to scale under new stewardship.

### Advisory Work & Governance

Today, David’s work centers on the intersection of technology, governance, and institutional stewardship. He designs AI-assisted operational frameworks that enhance decision-making clarity, strengthen documentation standards, and improve the reproducibility of complex systems in regulated environments. His focus is not automation for its own sake, but the cultivation of durable institutional capacity in an era of accelerating technological change.

David has supported civic and educational institutions through board service with the [Oregon State University Alumni Association](https://fororegonstate.org/), the [Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)](https://omsi.edu), and [LatinoBuilt](https://latinobuilt.org/), and has advised philanthropic initiatives focused on expanding Latino leadership and institutional development.

### Roots & Perspective

David is the son of Mexican immigrants from Nayarit, Mexico. Born in Hood River, Oregon, and raised in Mount Vernon, Washington, he grew up in migrant housing and agricultural communities in the Skagit Valley.

He attended public schools, briefly left high school to work in agriculture and seafood processing, and later returned to graduate — eventually becoming the first in his family to earn a university degree.

At Skagit Valley College, he founded a MEChA chapter and co-organized a cultural festival that brought together thousands of community members and raised funds for scholarships. At Oregon State University, he studied political science, participated in student government, and completed an international internship in Costa Rica focused on regional governance and development. He analyzed Spanish-language primary sources and produced English-language policy-oriented articles on socio-economic and political dynamics in Central America for a global subscriber base that included academic institutions and diplomatic audiences.

These formative experiences instilled a belief that opportunity, discipline, and institutional access must be expanded — not assumed.

### A Long View

David’s work has never been confined to a single sector. It has moved between uniform, legislation, enterprise, nonprofit, and advisory roles — each offering a vantage point on how institutions function and how they can be strengthened.

He is particularly interested in the evolving intersection of technology, governance, and public institutions — especially how emerging systems such as artificial intelligence reshape policy, commerce, and international relations.

Across every chapter, the objective has remained steady: build systems that endure, serve communities responsibly, and leave institutions stronger than they were found. He remains committed to contributing at the intersection of technology, governance, and public service in the years ahead.
