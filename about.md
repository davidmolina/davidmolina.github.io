I am the founder of [Operation Code](http://operationcode.org), co-founder at [BilingualHire](http://bilingualhire.co), [hobbyist photographer](https://www.instagram.com/davidcmolina/), and [family man](https://www.instagram.com/p/-u6FbsRUlR/?taken-by=davidcmolina). I tweet from [@davidcmolina](http://twitter.com/davidcmolina/) and email from [david@operationcode.org](mailto:david@operationcode.org). I write essays on [Medium](https://medium.com/@davidcmolina) and [this site](http://davidmolina.github.io/).

I started Operation Code in 2014 when I committed the [first line of code](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/commits/master).

Before that, I served as an [US Army Captain](https://www.instagram.com/p/BAiRSa8RUvp/?taken-by=davidcmolina) at the Joint Personal Effects Depot at Dover AFB and prior to that as an aide-de-camp to a flag officer (brigadier general). I began my military career as an enlisted private.

I grew up in Mt. Vernon, Washington, the son of Mexican immigrants from Nayarit and started my first job with Sakuma Farms and Olympic Fish Company. A former high school drop-out I went onto graduate high school a year late and do a few years at Skagit Valley Community College.
