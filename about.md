I am the founder of [Operation Code](http://operationcode.org), co-founder at [BilingualHire](http://bilingualhire.co), [amateur programmer](https://github.com/davidmolina), and [family man](https://www.instagram.com/p/-u6FbsRUlR/?taken-by=davidcmolina). I tweet from [@davidcmolina](http://twitter.com/davidcmolina/) and email from [david@operationcode.org](mailto:david@operationcode.org). I share stories on [Medium](https://medium.com/@davidcmolina) and [this site](http://davidmolina.github.io/).

I started Operation Code in 2014 when I committed the [first line of code](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/commits/master) after not being able to leverage my New GI Bill to go to code school.

Before that, I proudly served in our U.S. Army as an [ Captain](https://www.instagram.com/p/BAiRSa8RUvp/?taken-by=davidcmolina) at the Joint Personal Effects Depot on the Mortuary Affairs Complex at Dover AFB (active-duty) and once served as an aide-de-camp to a U.S. Army brigadier general. I began my enlisted career as a young private in 2000 at the Portland-based, 364th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne).

I grew up in Mt. Vernon, Washington, the son of Mexican immigrants from Nayarit and started my first job with Sakuma Brothers Farms and Olympic Fish Company. A former high school drop-out, I went onto barely graduate a year late and do a few years at Skagit Valley Community College before going to Oregon State University where I got an ROTC commission.
