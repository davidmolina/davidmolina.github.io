Hey, this is Dave Molina's personal site/blog using Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap.

# A quick note

I make no guarantees that if you fork or clone this, any of this will work. I'm a self-taught developer, and learn by doing. Literally. Also, any of my essays. Don't copy them without permission. If you do reference, link them back to my [personal site/blog](http://davidmolina.github.io).

Finally, thank you to all the kickass and amazing open source software developers out there, most especially those that have taken time over the years to teach me, walk me through code, hack + help, sponsored me, and helped get me to this point. Never forgetting where I come from, I'm trying to pay it forward with [Operation Code](http://operationcode.org).
