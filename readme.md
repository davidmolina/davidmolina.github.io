# http://davidmolina.github.io

This is the repository for my personal site http://davidmolina.github.io. Iâ€™m using Jekyll with GitHub Pages for easy building and storing. I used to have a Posterous, and I've posted once on Medium, but this is where I put my stuff.

# A quick note

I'm a self-taught developer, and learn by doing. Literally. If you see something here that doesn't make sense ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina).
