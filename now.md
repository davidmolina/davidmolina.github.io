Hey, I'm David Molina, entrepreneur, former Army Captain, and father of Maya, Paloma and Citlali, ages 15, 13 and 13.

I'm currently passionate about: exit planning/ scaling growth, government contracting and U.S. food security. I advise and help business owners with $1M+ revenue with scaling, valuations and selling their businesses. On the government contracting side, pursue mission-driven work and build out the management team. I serve as government affairs counselor for an ag startup supporting small American family farms. I pay it forward on the [Oregon State University (OSU) Alumni Association](https://fororegonstate.org/).

Previously, I served on the board of directors on the [Oregon Museum of Science and Industry](https://omsi.edu/), [LatinoBuilt](https://latinobuilt.org/), and Governor's Commission on Hispanic Affairs. In 2014 I founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org), an open source project turned veterans 501c(3) nonprofit on a mission to expand the New GI Bill to include code schools and helping transition veterans/ military family to careers in technology.

I served in uniform, enlisted and officer, as a Private First Class, Aide-de-Camp, Summary Court Martial Officer, Protocol Officer, Public Affairs Officers and S-2/3 OIC exiting Dover AFB in 2013 after a decade in uniform. In the 2018 election cycle I ran for the Oregon State Legislature to represent Forest Grove, Cornelius and West Hillsboro, but came up short in the general election against an entrenched incumbent. I started my career as a farmworker in the Skagit Valley picking berries, harvesting oysters and driving forklift/ trucks for fruit warehouses.

In the last year I've been enrolled in a masterclass focused on nutrition and lifestyle medicine to heal, reduce inflammation and improve my health.
- Physical. I hike weekly and lift resulting in dropping over 50 lbs., healthier vitals and more regenerative sleep.
- Nutrition. I follow religiously the guidance of [Dr. Labrada](https://www.facebook.com/DiabetesDrLabradanutr/) and [Dr. Fernandez](https://www.facebook.com/Dr.EduardoFernandez) avoiding processed foods, sugary drinks and a focus on real food.
- Family. I spend intentional time w/ family, daughters and exploring new places to make memories.
- Business. Slowing down to go further, faster building a scaleable, repeatable, and profitable model one that is the best and most optimal use of my time and skills.
- Podcasts. [The Momentum Lab](https://www.charfen.com/podcast/) and the [Order of Man](https://www.orderofman.com/).
- Music. I listen to a wide range of music depending on the task at hand with each having a way of teaching us lessons. Many times I prefer classical, EDM or DJ Enrie when I write.
- Reading. I'm a voracious reader and enjoy books and articles on strategy, technology, AI, investments, architecture and poetry.
- Writing. I blog in markdown using Jekyll, a static site generator, iTerm to push my thoughts, Netlify to host, and GitHub to store my code. In the past I've blogged using WordPress, Tumblr, Posterous, and Medium to blog and have been a guest blogger on multiple outlets.
