Hey, I'm David Molina. I live in Portland, Oregon, the city where young people go to retire. Our twin daughters, Paloma & Citlali, are 9, and Maya our oldest is 11.

Currently, I'm focused full time on building and scaling a full service civil construction company from the ground up at [Molinas Construction Co](ttps://www.molinas.co). Previously, I founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org), a national nonprofit charity focused on helping members of the military community learn to code and ensure veterans could use their New GI Bill to go to code school. In the 2018 Oregon political cycle I ran (and lost) to represent the hard working people of [western Washington County](https://www.molinafororegon.com/) for House District 29. In 2013, I exited Dover AFB as an Army Captain after serving over a decade in uniform. As time permits I attend Oregon State University alumni and Military Officers Association of America functions.

Business and family obligations aside, you can usually find me learning:
- statistics
- mathematics/ pre-calculus
