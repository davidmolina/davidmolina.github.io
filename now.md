Still living in Forest Grove, Oregon and commuting into the Portland office. Our twin girls are age 6, 6, our oldest is 8, and all fast becoming more and more fluent in Spanish everyday.

I'm reading a lot on finance, management, and strategy while listening to a lot of [EDM](https://open.spotify.com/user/1137072174/playlist/4XAEkK9s6yTAGyTtaMEC0e) and [Ignacio Robles](https://open.spotify.com/user/123891019/playlist/2NFJsDhYBgIs5cRWzYZsfb) all while continuing to learn to program on my own. I maintain the [ThinkMujer](https://thinkmujer.com) site and from time to time contribute to the many [Operation Code repositories](https://github.com/OperationCode/) repositories as our core team and contributor team has expanded. I'm continuing to learn Ruby and learn at my own pace and going through [People Can Program](https://peoplecanprogram.com/index.html) as time permits.

I was awarded a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs federal contract where I'm self-performing and operating an CAT 316E excavator and subcontracting the transportation to a local trucking outfit. I've also just graduated the [Clark Construction Group Strategic Partnership Program](http://clarkconstruction.com/news/clark-kicks-strategic-partnership-program-seattle) Seattle first inaugural class and expanding into the commercial sector. I'm continuing to enjoy the business side and building teams.

My day-to-day consist of a nice blend of:
- business development for family-owned and operated construction company (Molinas Construction Company)
- strategy and growth for nonprofit startup helping the military community learn software development, enter the tech industry, and code the future (Operation Code)
- strategy and growth for Latina-focused education company (ThinkMujer)

When not building the businesses, I'm thinking about growing the businesses and trying to blog more.
