title: What I'm Doing Now

I live in Forest Grove, Oregon and work out of my downtown Portland office, when I'm not on the road or in the field. Our twin girls are ages 6, 6, and 8, respectively, and all fast becoming more fluent in Spanish everyday.

I'm reading a lot on finance, management, and strategy while listening to a lot of [EDM](https://open.spotify.com/user/1137072174/playlist/4XAEkK9s6yTAGyTtaMEC0e) and [Ignacio Robles](https://open.spotify.com/user/123891019/playlist/2NFJsDhYBgIs5cRWzYZsfb) all while continuing to learn to program on my own. I maintain the [ThinkMujer](https://thinkmujer.com) site built using Jekyll and from time to time contribute to the many [Operation Code repositories](https://github.com/OperationCode/) as our core team and contributor team has expanded. This site is built using Ruby on Rails, but in the near future it will be rails (back-end) and react (front-end). I'm continuing to learn Ruby and learn at my own pace and going through [People Can Program](https://peoplecanprogram.com/index.html) as time permits.

I was awarded a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs federal contract where I'm self-performing and operating an CAT 316E excavator and subcontracting the transportation to a local trucking outfit. I've also just graduated the [Clark Construction Group Strategic Partnership Program](http://clarkconstruction.com/news/clark-kicks-strategic-partnership-program-seattle) Seattle first inaugural class and expanding into the commercial sector. I'm continuing to enjoy the business side and building teams.

My day-to-day consist of a nice blend of:
- [Molinas Construction Company](https://www.molinas.co/), a family-owned construction company
- [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/), a nonprofit charity helping the military community learn software development, enter the tech industry, and code the future
- [ThinkMujer](https://www.thinkmujer.com/), an education company focused on the professional development of Latina women 

When not building the businesses, I'm thinking about growing the businesses and trying to blog more and share my adventures on [social media](/connecting).
