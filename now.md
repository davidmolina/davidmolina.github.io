Hey, I'm David Molina. I live in Portland, Oregon, the [city hanging on by a thread to survive](https://www.koin.com/is-portland-over/from-wonderful-to-war-zone-portlands-reputation-transformation/). Our girls, Paloma, Citlali, and Maya are 11, 11, and 13.

Currently, I'm focused on scaling a construction company from the ground up at [Molinas Construction Company](ttps://www.molinas.co) and paying it forward on several boards, including [LatinoBuilt](https://latinobuilt.org/), [OSU Alumni Association](https://fororegonstate.org/), and the [Oregon Museum of Science and Industry](https://omsi.edu/history-and-mission). Previously, I founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org), an open source project turned national/ international veterans 501c(3) nonprofit focused on helping members of the military community and their families learn to code and join the tech ecosystem with over 9,000 numbering on Slack. In the 2018 Oregon election cycle I ran for the state legislature to represent [Forest Grove, Cornelius and West Hillsboro](https://www.molinafororegon.com/), but came up short in the general election against an entrenched incumbent. Between 2000 to 2013 I served in uniform, enlisted and officer, exiting Dover Air Force Base as an Army Captain to turn my attention to social entrepreneurship.

Routines:
- Physical. Walk, jog, hike or run-- but moving at least daily.
- Fuel. I enjoy celery and fruit juices from [Medical Medium](https://linktr.ee/medicalmedium). I start my morning's with raw garlic, B-12, Zinc, lemon tea, migrate to straight black coffee by day, and Belage/ Kronuit throughout and evening. From time to time, I enjoy a nice adult beverage.  
- Work. I run a federal and commercial contracting company and throughout my days rotate between strategy, operations and tactics, ranging from branding to recruiting/ retaining the best and brightest to ensuring enough money in the bank and coaching our management team to scale further faster.
- Podcasts. I'm currently listening to the [Momentum Lab](https://www.charfen.com/podcast/), the [Persuasion Lab](https://open.spotify.com/show/1tXMK3wDIghWGDXxI2IGfW), [Dirt Talk](https://www.buildwitt.com/dirt-talk/page/1), and [Watchdog on Wall Street](https://watchdogonwallstreet.com/).
- Reading. I'm currently reading [Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/).
- Family. I enjoy spending unannounced, unplanned time w/ my girls, playing chess and exploring new places to make memories.
- Blog. I enjoy writing in markdown and using the command line to push code up to GitHub and onto the interwebs. I started first with Tumblr, then Posterous, then Medium, and now I just use Jekyll, a static site generator, exclusively.
