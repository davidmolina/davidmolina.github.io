I'm David Molina and live in Forest Grove, Oregon, a small town west of Portland. Our daughters, Maya, Paloma & Citlali, are ages 10, 8, and 8, respectively.

Currently, I'm focused on building and scaling the family business [Molinas Construction](https://www.molinas.co), serving on the board of [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/), and previously ran for [House District 29 state representative](https://www.molinafororegon.com/).

Work and family aside, you can usually find me learning:
- react
- vim
