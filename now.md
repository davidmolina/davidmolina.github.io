Hey, I'm David Molina, entrepreneur, former Army Captain, and father of Maya, Paloma and Citlali, ages 15, 13 and 13.

I split my time in a few areas that am currently passionate about: exit planning/ scaling growth, government contracting and U.S. food security. I advise and help business owners with $1M+ revenue with scaling, valuations and selling their businesses. On the government contracting side, bidding and building out the team. I also serve as government affairs counselor for an ag startup supporting small American family farms. I pay it forward on the [Oregon State University (OSU) Alumni Association](https://fororegonstate.org/).

Previously, I served on the board of directors at the [Oregon Museum of Science and Industry](https://omsi.edu/), [LatinoBuilt](https://latinobuilt.org/), and Governor's Commission on Hispanic Affairs. In 2014 I founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org), an open source project turned veterans 501c(3) nonprofit focused on expanding the New GI Bill to include code schools. In the 2018 Oregon election cycle I ran for the state legislature to represent [Forest Grove, Cornelius and West Hillsboro](https://www.molinafororegon.com/), but came up short in the general election against an entrenched incumbent. Between 2000 to 2013 I served in uniform, enlisted and officer, serving throughout my career as a Private First Class, Aide-de-Camp, and S-2/3 OIC exiting Dover Air Force Base in 2013. I started my career as a farmworker in the Skagit Valley picking berries, harvesting oysters and driving forklift/ trucks for fruit warehouses.

Routines, the last year I've been enrolled in a masterclass focused on nutrition and lifestyle medicine to heal, reduce inflammation and make better decisions.
- Physical. I hike weekly and lift resulting in dropping over 50 lbs.  
- Nutrition. I follow religiously the guidance of [Dr. Labrada](https://www.facebook.com/DiabetesDrLabradanutr/) and [Dr. Fernandez](https://www.facebook.com/Dr.EduardoFernandez) and aim for real food.
- Family. I spend intentional time w/ family, daughters and exploring new places to make memories.
- Business. Slowing down to go further, faster in a scaleable, repeatable, and profitable manner. One that is intentional and is the best use of mine and client's time.
- Podcasts. [The Momentum Lab](https://www.charfen.com/podcast/) and the [Order of Man](https://www.orderofman.com/).
- Music. I listen to a wide range of music depending on the task at hand. Each has a way of teaching us lessons. Many times I prefer it quiet or playing classic (no words) when I need to write.
- Reading. I'm currently reading through [Ray Dalio's books](https://www.principles.com/), Dwell and architecture. I also enjoy reading poems by Mary Oliver. I use Libby, and audio books.
- Writing. I blog in markdown and using iTerm to push my thoughts up to GitHub and onto the internet. I use Jekyll, a static site generator, exclusively using Netlify to host. In the past I've blogged using WordPress, Tumblr, Posterous, and Medium to post my thoughts.
