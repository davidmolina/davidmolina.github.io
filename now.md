I focus on institutional strategy within the context of North American interdependence — examining how governance systems adapt to economic integration, technological acceleration, and shared structural pressures across borders.

My work centers on strengthening decision frameworks, improving operational clarity, and enhancing executive visibility in complex, regulated environments. I am particularly interested in how institutional capacity, food system stability, and emerging technologies shape long-term resilience across the Western Hemisphere.

I write on hemispheric governance, agricultural stability, and technology policy, with an emphasis on bilateral coordination, long-horizon stability, and institutional modernization.

Open to thoughtful dialogue on North American resilience, public service, and the evolving relationship between governance and technology.
