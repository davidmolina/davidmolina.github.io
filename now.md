Hey, I'm David Molina. I live in Portland, Oregon, the city where young people go to retire. Our twin daughters, Paloma & Citlali, are 9, and Maya our oldest is 11.

Currently, I'm focused full time on building and scaling a full service
civil construction company from the ground up at [Molinas Construction Co](ttps://www.molinas.co). Previously, I founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org), a nonprofit startup focused on helping members of the military community learn to code and ensure veterans could use their New GI Bill to go to code school. In the 2018 Oregon political cycle I ran for House District 29 to represent the hard working people of [western Washington County](https://www.molinafororegon.com/). Didn't win the general election. In 2013, I exited Dover AFB as an Army Captain after serving over a decade in uniform, both enlisted and officer, to turn my attention to building companies and raising a family full time.

Usual routine:
- [#75HARD](https://75hard.com/info) both in the gym and outside--I've had to re-start this one a few times
- Learning statistics, mathematics/ pre-calculus
- Juicing- I use recipes from [Medical Medium](https://linktr.ee/medicalmedium)
- Experimenting in the kitchen (and, grill)
- Mentoring others, speaking to young people about entrepreneurship
- Accounting <- this one is challenging to say the least->
