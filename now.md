Hey, I'm David Molina, entrepreneur, [strategist](https://molinas.consulting/), blogger, former Army Captain, and father of Maya, Paloma and Citlali, ages 17, 15 and 15.

After a combined 20+ years of service to country in uniform, various startups and companies ranging in size and customers I'm on mission to channel these experiences and lessons learned to best help business owners scale, exit and retire. Too many can't or unable to and that's a tragedy.

As a business broker, I advise and help structure, navigate entrepreneurs/business owners with $500,000+ annual revenue sell their business w/ or without real property.

Previously, I served on the boards of the [Oregon State University Alumni Association (OSUAA)](https://fororegonstate.org/), [Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)](https://omsi.edu), [LatinoBuilt](https://latinobuilt.org/), and [Oregon Commission on Hispanic Affairs](https://www.oregon.gov/oac/ocha/Pages/index.aspx).

In the 2018 election cycle I ran for the Oregon State Legislature to represent Forest Grove, Cornelius and west Hillsboro, but came up short in the general election against an entrenched incumbent. 

After military service I tried using my New GI Bill to study mobile/ web development and couldn't due to federal government red tape. Tired of waiting I self-taught myself enough Ruby on Rails to be dangerous and founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org) to lobby Congress to expand the New GI Bill to include code schools and help transition veterans/ military family to careers in software development and build the nation's technical talent pipeline shortage w/ veterans and military spouses.

I served in uniform, enlisted and officer, as a Private First Class, Cadet, Aide-de-Camp to a General Officer, Summary Court Martial Officer, Protocol Officer, Public Affairs Officers and Plans/ Training/ Operations (S-2/3) Officer in Charge (OIC) exiting Dover Air Force Base in 2013 after a decade in uniform.

I started my career as a farmworker in the Skagit Valley picking strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, tulips, cucumbers, driving forklift/ trucks for fruit warehouses, and harvesting oysters off Padilla Bay.

Over the last 2.5 years I've been healing via lifestyle medicine focused on health, family and work in that order.
- Physical. I hike, walk and lift regularly resulting in dropping from 302 lbs. down to 216.5/222 lbs. w/ healthier vitals and more regenerative sleep. I've started and stopped [75Hard](https://andyfrisella.com/blogs/articles/what-is-75-hard) about 9 times and regularly post my progress on [social media](/connecting/).
- Nutrition. I follow the guidance of Mexican doctors Dr. Labrada and Dr. Fernandez avoiding processed and a focus on real food and [restorative rest](https://davidmolina.github.io/2023/10/25/the-power-of-a-lymphatic-drainage-massage/).
- Family. I spend intentional time w/ loved ones exploring new places to make memories.
- Podcasts. [The Momentum Lab](https://www.charfen.com/podcast/) and the [Order of Man](https://www.orderofman.com/).
- Reading. I'm a voracious reader and consume everything from strategy to back office technology, and from commercial real estate investments to poetry. 
- Music. I listen to a wide range of music depending on the task at hand with each having a way of teaching us lessons. [Here are some of my fave](https://open.spotify.com/user/123891019/playlists), but a good amount of time I prefer quiet or whatever nature has in store.
- Writing. I blog in markdown using Jekyll, a static site generator, Visual Code Studio as the editor, iTerm to transmit,  Netlify to host and deploy, and [GitHub](https://github.com/davidmolina) to store my work. Previously, I used WordPress, DotNetNuke, [Tumblr](https://davidcmolina.tumblr.com/), Posterous, and Medium as blogging platforms.
- Advisor & CEO Coach. Strategizing for [clients](https://molinas.consulting/) in the areas of strategic planning, valuations, and exit planning. 
- Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Broker. I help entrepreneurs/ investors buy and sell property with a focus on wealth creation, portfolio diversification, and passive income. Let me know if you want to buy an investment found on [Crexi](https://www.crexi.com/) or [CoStar](https://www.costar.com/).
- Business Broker. I help entrepreneurs with exiting strategy, from longterm/ legacy to emergency exits, and stucture deals. [Get in touch](https://calendly.com/davidcmolina/) if you want to sell your business and want to go over your options.
- Speaking. I've given a few talks. Definitely open to sharing some thoughts.
