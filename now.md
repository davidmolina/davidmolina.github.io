Hey, I'm David Molina, entrepreneur, [strategist](https://molinas.consulting/), blogger, former Army Captain, and father of Maya, Paloma and Citlali, ages 16, 14 and 14.

After a combined 20+ years of service to country in uniform, various startups and companies ranging in size and customers I'm on mission to channel these experiences and lessons learned to best help business owners scale, exit and retire. Too many can't or unable to and that's a tragedy.

As a business broker, I advise and help navigate entrepreneurs/business owners with $500,000+ annual revenue sell their business so they can retire before the age of 82 and move onto the next chapter in their lives.

Previously, I served on the boards of the [Oregon State University Alumni Association (OSUAA)](https://fororegonstate.org/), [Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)](https://omsi.edu), [LatinoBuilt](https://latinobuilt.org/), and [Oregon Commission on Hispanic Affairs](https://www.oregon.gov/oac/ocha/Pages/index.aspx).

In the 2018 election cycle I ran for the Oregon State Legislature to represent Forest Grove, Cornelius and west Hillsboro, but came up short in the general election against an entrenched incumbent. 

After military service I tried using my New GI Bill to study mobile/ web development and couldn't due to federal government red tape. Tired of waiting I self-taught myself enough Ruby on Rails and founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org) to lobby Congress to expand the New GI Bill to include code schools and help transition veterans/ military family to careers in software development and build the nation's technical talent pipeline shortage w/ veterans and military spouses.

I served in uniform, enlisted and officer, as a Private First Class, Cadet, Aide-de-Camp to a General Officer, Summary Court Martial Officer, Protocol Officer, Public Affairs Officers and S-2/3 Officer in Charge (OIC) exiting Dover Air Force Base in 2013 after a decade in uniform.

I started my career as a farmworker in the Skagit Valley picking strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, tulips, cucumbers, driving forklift/ trucks for fruit warehouses, and harvesting oysters off Padilla Bay.

Over the last 2.5 years I've been healing via lifestyle medicine focused on health, family and work in that order.
- Physical. I hike, walk and lift regularly resulting in dropping from 302 lbs. down to 216.5/222 lbs. w/ healthier vitals and more regenerative sleep. I've started and stopped [75Hard](https://andyfrisella.com/blogs/articles/what-is-75-hard) about 9 times and regularly post my progress on [social media](/connecting/).
- Nutrition. I follow the guidance of Dr. Labrada and Dr. Fernandez avoiding processed foods, sugary drinks and a focus on real food and [restorative rest](https://davidmolina.github.io/2023/10/25/the-power-of-a-lymphatic-drainage-massage/).
- Family. I spend intentional time w/ loved ones and exploring new places to make intentional memories.
- Business. Building systems & processes for a scaleable, repeatable, and profitable business model, one that is the best and most optimal use of my time with a focus on compound revenue and profit first.
- Podcasts. [The Momentum Lab](https://www.charfen.com/podcast/) and the [Order of Man](https://www.orderofman.com/).
- Music. I listen to a wide range of music depending on the task at hand with each having a way of teaching us lessons. [Here are some of my fave](https://open.spotify.com/user/123891019/playlists). 
- Reading. I'm a voracious reader and consume everything from strategy to back end back office technology, and from generative AI to commercial real estate.
- Writing. I blog in markdown using Jekyll, a static site generator, iTerm to push my thoughts, Visual Code Studio as nn editor, Netlify to host, and GitHub to store my code. In the past I've blogged using WordPress, DotNetNuke, Tumblr, Posterous, and Medium. Spending most of my time strategizing for [clients](https://molinas.consulting/).
- Speaking. I've given a few talks. [Get in touch](https://calendly.com/davidcmolina/) if you'd like to discuss getting on my calendar.
