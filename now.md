Hey, I'm David Molina, entrepreneur, former Army Captain, and father of Maya, Paloma and Citlali, ages 14, 12 and 12, currently working remote.

I'm focused on scaling a construction company from the ground up at [Molinas Construction Company](ttps://www.molinas.co) and paying it forward on several boards, including [Oregon State University (OSU) Alumni Association](https://fororegonstate.org/), and the [Oregon Museum of Science and Industry](https://omsi.edu/history-and-mission). Previously, I served on the [LatinoBuilt](https://latinobuilt.org/) board of directors, a membership trade association focused on building generational wealth for Oregon/ SW Washington Latino contractors. A few years ago I founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org), an open source project turned national/ international veterans 501c(3) nonprofit focused on helping members of the military community and their families learn to code and join the tech ecosystem with over 10,000 numbering on Slack. In the 2018 Oregon election cycle I ran for the state legislature to represent [Forest Grove, Cornelius and West Hillsboro](https://www.molinafororegon.com/), but came up short in the general election against an entrenched incumbent. Between 2000 to 2013 I served in uniform, enlisted and officer, departing Dover Air Force Base as an Army Captain to turn my attention to entrepreneurship and impactful change full time.

Routines:
- Physical. Walk, jog, hike or run-- but moving at least daily. I enjoy lifting and racquetball w/ my girls.
- Fuel. I start my morning's with raw garlic, B-12, Zinc, lemon tea, migrate to straight black coffee by day, and Belage/ Kronuit throughout and evening. I love celery, vampiros (vampires), green juices from [Medical Medium](https://linktr.ee/medicalmedium) recipes.   
- Business. I run a federal contracting company and throughout my days rotate between strategy and operations where I focus on meeting federal procurement requirements to building a team to go further, faster.
- Mentorship. I enjoy building other teams as well. Currently not an investor in any others, but regardless, I enjoy passing on what I know to help others get there. It's the tide that lifts all boats.
- Podcasts. I'm currently listening to the [Momentum Lab](https://www.charfen.com/podcast/) and the [Persuasion Lab](https://open.spotify.com/show/1tXMK3wDIghWGDXxI2IGfW). Reading wise, I use Libby, and when it's not avail I pick up the hardcopy.
- Music. I listen to a wide range of music, ranging from corridos to house, and from classical to country, depending on the task at hand. Each has a way of teaching us lessons. Many times I like quiet and the sound of the air.
- Reading. I'm currently reading and trying to get through [Ray Dalio's books](https://www.principles.com/), and love reading each Dwell copy.
- Family. I enjoy spending unannounced, unplanned time w/ my three girls, playing chess, teaching them to code, and exploring new places to make memories. Favorite past time: grilling whatever is in season. 
- Writing. I enjoy blogging in markdown and using the command line to push my work up to GitHub and onto the net. I started first with Tumblr, then Posterous, then Medium, and now I just use Jekyll, a static site generator, exclusively, and using Netlify to host.
