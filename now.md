I live in Forest Grove, Oregon and work out of my downtown Portland office, when I'm not on the road or in the field. Our twin girls are ages 7, 7, and 9, respectively, and growing quickly.

I'm focused a ton on building and scaling two startups: a federal contracting company I launched when exiting Dover AFB, and [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/). When I'm not working, I'm learning Gatsby.js, fixing my personal credit, hanging w/ girls, and improving my credit score.

Oh, and I'm also running for State Representative, House District 29. If you'd like to follow the campaign, [visit our campaign page](https://www.molinafororegon.com/).

This `/now` page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) and his /[now project](https://sivers.org/nowff).
