I live in Forest Grove, Oregon and when I'm not on the road or in the field, I work out of my downtown Portland office. Our daughters are ages 7, 7, and 9, respectively, and growing quickly.

I'm focused on building and scaling two startups: a federal contracting company, and [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/). If that wasn't enough I'm also running for State Representative House District 29 to bring new leadership and a fresh perspective to the Salem Capitol. If you'd like to follow the campaign, [visit our campaign page](https://www.molinafororegon.com/).

When I'm not building companies, I'm hanging w/ my girls, learning Gatsby.js, and improving my personal credit score.

This `/now` page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) and his /[now project](https://sivers.org/nowff).
