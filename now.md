title: What I'm Doing Now

Still living in Forest Grove, Oregon and commuting into the Portland office. The girls are age 6, 6, and 8 and becoming more and more fluent in Spanish everyday.

I'm reading a lot on finance, management, strategy and listening to a lot of [EDM](https://open.spotify.com/user/1137072174/playlist/4XAEkK9s6yTAGyTtaMEC0e) and [Ignacio Robles](https://open.spotify.com/user/123891019/playlist/2NFJsDhYBgIs5cRWzYZsfb) while continuing to learn to code on my own and although I've stopped taking on web clients (exception of maintaining [ThinkMujer](https://thinkmujer.com)), and scaled back on maintaining [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/) as our core team and contributor team has expanded, I'm continuing to learn Ruby on my own.

I just completed a 7-week VA contract operating an CAT 316E excavator and moving thousands of cubic yards of dirt between 12 yard and 8 yard trucks, and enrolled in the Clark Construction Group Stategic Partnership Program in Seattle. I'm continuing to enjoy the business side and building teams.

My day-to-day consist of a nice blend of:
- scouring FBO, ORPIN and other databases for contracting opportunities and collaborating with generals and subcontractors (work)
- collaborating w/ the Operation Code team on Slack in a completely remote/decentralized operating environment (volunteer)
- collaborating w/ my wife's education company, ThinkMujer, on strategy and growth

When not working, I'm answering emails (always) and reading about becoming a better writer.
