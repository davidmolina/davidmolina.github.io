Hey, I'm David Molina. I live in Portland, Oregon, the city where young people go to retire. Our girls, Maya, Paloma & Citlali, are 12, 10, and 10.

Currently, I'm focused full time on scaling a small general contractor and excavation company from the ground up at [Molinas Construction Co](ttps://www.molinas.co). Previously, I founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org), a veterans nonprofit focused on helping members of the military community learn to code and ensure veterans could use their New GI Bill to go to code school from 2014-2018. In the 2018 Oregon political cycle I ran for House District 29 to represent the hard working people of [western Washington County](https://www.molinafororegon.com/). Unfortunately, I came up short in the general election. In 2013, I exited Dover AFB as an Army Captain after serving over a decade in uniform, both enlisted and officer, to turn my attention to building companies and co-raising three girls.

Usual routine:
- Physical. Running, walk, jog or run-- but moving at least daily. Yoga, an excellent opportunity to stretch long lost muscles and tone down. [#75HARD](https://75hard.com/info), I've had to re-start this one a few times (hint: it's not the physical)
- Diet. I enjoy celery and fruit juices. I use recipes from [Medical Medium](https://linktr.ee/medicalmedium). I start my morning's with a lemon juice, migrate to black coffee by day, and bourbon whisky by afternoon. Evenings, usually you can me grilling anything fresh. When I'm on the go, I enjoy hydrating w/ regular water+ key lime juice+ a pinch of Himalayan pink salt.
- Work. I run a startup and usually bounce between business dev, accounting/ cost coding to training and coaching. Been focused on streamlining, building better systems/ processes, and working w/ our management team to scale better, faster.
- Volunteering. I serve on several boards, including [LatinoBuilt](https://latinobuilt.org/), a Latino contractor trade association and the [local chapter](https://aspe54.org/) of the American Society of Professional Estimators (ASPE) helping our members build and scale.
- Stanford Graduate School of Business Executive Education. I'm in the seventh cohort of the [Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative Education](https://lban.us/slei-ed-scaling-program/), Scaling Program.
- Family. I enjoy spending unannounced, unplanned time w/ family and friends.
