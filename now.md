Hey, I'm David Molina, entrepreneur, [strategist](https://molinas.consulting/), former Army Captain, and father of Maya, Paloma and Citlali, ages 16, 14 and 14.

After a combined 20+ years of service to country in uniform, various startups and companies ranging in size and customers I'm on mission to channel these experiences and lessons learned to best help business owners exit and retire.

As a business broker, I advise and help navigate entrepreneurs/business owners with $500,000+ annual revenue sell their business so they can retire before the age of 82 and move onto the next chapter in their lives.

Previously, I served on the boards of the [Oregon State University Alumni Association (OSUAA)](https://fororegonstate.org/), [Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)](https://omsi.edu), [LatinoBuilt](https://latinobuilt.org/), and [Oregon Commission on Hispanic Affairs](https://www.oregon.gov/oac/ocha/Pages/index.aspx).

In the 2018 election cycle I ran for the Oregon State Legislature to represent Forest Grove, Cornelius and West Hillsboro, but came up short in the general election against an entrenched incumbent.

After military service I tried using my New GI Bill to study mobile/ web development and couldn't due to federal government red tape. Tired of waiting I self-taught myself enough Ruby on Rails and founded and led [Operation Code](https://www.operationcode.org) to lobby Congress to expand the New GI Bill to include code schools and help transition veterans/ military family to careers in software development and build the nation's technical talent pipeline shortage w/ veterans and military spouses.

I served in uniform, enlisted and officer, as a Private First Class, Cadet, Aide-de-Camp to a General Officer, Summary Court Martial Officer, Protocol Officer, Public Affairs Officers and S-2/3 Officer in Charge (OIC) exiting Dover Air Force Base in 2013 after a decade in uniform.

I started my career as a farmworker in the Skagit Valley picking strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, tulips, cucumbers, driving forklift/ trucks for fruit warehouses, and harvesting oysters off Padilla Bay.

In the last 18 months I've been enrolled in a masterclass focused on lifestyle medicine to heal, reduce inflammation and improve my health.
- Physical. I hike and walk weekly and lift resulting in dropping from 299lb.+ to 225 lbs. w/ healthier vitals and more regenerative sleep. I've started and stopped 75Hard about 9 times.
- Nutrition. I follow religiously the guidance of [Dr. Labrada](https://www.facebook.com/DiabetesDrLabradanutr/) and [Dr. Fernandez](https://www.facebook.com/Dr.EduardoFernandez) avoiding processed foods, sugary drinks and a focus on real food.
- Family. I spend intentional time w/ family, daughters and exploring new places to make intentional memories.
- Business. Slowing down to go further, faster building a scaleable, repeatable, and profitable model one that is the best and most optimal use of my time and skills and those on the team.
- Podcasts. [The Momentum Lab](https://www.charfen.com/podcast/) and the [Order of Man](https://www.orderofman.com/).
- Music. I listen to a wide range of music depending on the task at hand with each having a way of teaching us lessons. Many times I prefer classical, EDM or DJ Enrie when I write.
- Reading. I'm a voracious reader and enjoy books and articles on strategy, technology, AI, investments, architecture and poetry.
- Writing. I blog in markdown using Jekyll, a static site generator, iTerm to push my thoughts, Netlify to host, and GitHub to store my code. In the past I've blogged using WordPress, Tumblr, Posterous, and Medium to blog and have been a guest blogger on multiple outlets.
