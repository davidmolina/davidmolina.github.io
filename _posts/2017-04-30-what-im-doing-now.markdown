Every so often I'm asked what I'm doing now. These questions come from friends and/or family and they arrive through Facebook messenger or email (or phone call). Through exploring how other entrepreneurs and software engineers solve this predicament, I came across [Derek Silvers /now page](https://sivers.org/nowff) and I was hooked.

So now I too have a [/now page](https://www.davidcmolina.com/now/) and look forward to sending friends and family to this page when I'm asked what I'm doing now.

Simply put, the /now page summarizes in a few seconds what I'm doing now, from residence & family, to work and what has my attention.
