Who knew the need for bilingual (Spanish/English) temporary staff was high in demand? In late November either everyone was on Thanksgiving-Christmas-Holiday mode or were telling us, "hold off a bit, we got some need in the new year." January 2011 kicked off and we started placing BilingualHire Associates out in the field and doing payroll. First e-newsletter of the decade and we were slammed with resumes and temp hiring-interest far and wide. This is all great news. Hence, the post title.
