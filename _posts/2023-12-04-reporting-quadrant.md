This afternoon I observed a conversation between an owner and an employee. The conversation centered on updates, taskers, and what is expected.

At a high level these are covered in a job description. A job description covers these in detail, but what about organizationally and day-to-day?

Roles/ responsibilities
Often we see roles/ responsibilities early on before applying but what tools are avail once the employee (or subordinates) are in place and how do you keep the updates clear, concise, measurable and informative?

On active duty at Dover AFB the commander’s briefing centered on a briefing quadrant. Looked like this

Reporting Quadrant:
```javascript
- __________|__________
- Top left: Working on now
- Top right: Working on next few
- Bottom left: Next few months
- Bottom right: What’s keeping me up
```

The briefing tool is designed to be interactive, including:
- Few bullet items per quadrant
- Quantitive and qualitative data points
- What’s on the burner now and where is our attention going
- Provides team members opportunity to engage, discover and troubleshoot
- Everyone in the briefing learns quickly
- The senior or owner adds value on the last quadrant by unbottlenecking issues which builds further momentum

The key is to make updates informative, organized and provide an opportunity to discover bottlenecks. Owners have the most influence here. This is where they should live the most and pays the most dividends.
