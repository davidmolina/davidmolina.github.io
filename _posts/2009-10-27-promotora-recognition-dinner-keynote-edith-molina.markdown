On Wed., Oct 14, 2009, my wife, Edith Molina, gave the keynote address at the 2009 Promotora Recognition Dinner hosted at Tuality Healthcare in Hillsboro, Oregon. The evening honored the work, commitment and dedication the Promotora/es de Salud (Community Health Workers) provide day in and day out to the most under-served, and under-privileged in the Latina/o community. Hope you will enjoy the podcast of her remarks in Spanish!
