This past Sunday I met up for lunch w/ fellow veteran [Kyle Holmberg](https://kylemh.com/) who was in town for [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2017/), the largest annual gathering for the community that uses and develops the open-source Python programming language.

I took him over to the Hawthorne District and we enjoyed some Mole burritos at my friend's sustainable taqueria, [Cha Cha Cha Taqueria & Bar](http://www.chachachapdx.com/mission.html). Due to Operation Code's remote and decentralized structure, it's rare I meet our veterans in person (unless we're at a conference) and so anytime I get a chance to do that, time permitting, I will.

It gives me a unique opportunity to share not just what we're doing and where we're going, but more importantly what is that our members love about the community and what they are looking forward to.

It turns out that at the top of that list was a scholarship license we had issued him from [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/), a programming preparatory company designed to help individuals better prepare for their interviews to land offers at companies like Google and Facebook.

Already we have issued out about a half a dozen licenses to veteran members to prep for their upcoming interviews. He was very appreciative of the scholarship.

At Operation Code, we work as a unit. And, that Interview Cake coordination and scholarship setup was due to our Utah Chapter Leader Ken Collier's dedicated efforts who secured it.
