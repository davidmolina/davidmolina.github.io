farmhand and later in life as bartender and small business owner.

Don Chevio never got the opportunity to attend formal schooling as he
began to work at an early age to support his family. At 14, Don
Chevio left Embocadero moving to Compostela to seed and harvest corn,
zucchini, and cucumber. He started the family business raising
organic pigs for sale in the local farmers market.

Guadalupe, Catalina, Rosa Carmina, Eusebio, Maria del Rosario, and
Francisco Javier.

Don Chevio set an example for all of us, by showing loving acts of unconditional kindness, generosity, positivity, and unwavering work ethic despite being illiterate and his physical disabilities. He could often be heard singing, dancing, and gifting a bottle of tequila to family during birthdays and special holidays. Don Chevio had a way of making everyone he met feel special with his laughter and genuine words. He looked forward to weekend gatherings with all of his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren and called them dearly by, "mis hijos y mis hijas". Don Chevio was a consummate “gentleman” and will be deeply missed.
