He was born September 11th, 1932 to Aurelio Flores and Catalina Lopez in Embocadero, Nayarit. He was preceded in death by his loving wife of 31 years, Inez Fonseca. He was also preceded in death by his siblings, Roberto, Lupe, Petritra, and Cenayda. He grew up working as a farmhand and later in life as bartender and small business owner. Eusebio loved gardening, fishing, traveling, and making the annual trek to Talpa de Allende, Jalisco. He enjoyed visits from his good friend and right hand Don Lencho and brother Don Chimiano.

Don Chevio never got the opportunity to attend formal schooling as he began to work at an early age to support his family. At 14, Don Chevio left Embocadero moving to Compostela to work as a farmworker helping seed and harvest corn, zucchini, and cucumber. He started the family business raising organic pigs for sale in the local farmers market. For over 30 years he was a bartender for Cantina Dos Equis/ Chevios Bar. He married the love of his life, Inez Fonseca, in ~1962 and raised five children: Guadalupe, Catalina, Rosa Carmina, Eusebio, Maria del Rosario, and Francisco Javier.

Don Chevio set an example for all of us, by showing loving acts of unconditional kindness, generosity, positivity, and unwavering work ethic despite his physical disabilities. He could often be heard singing, dancing, and gifting a bottle of tequila to family during birthdays and special holidays. Don Chevio had a way of making everyone he met feel special with his laughter and genuine words. He looked forward to weekend gatherings with all of his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Don Chevio was a consummate “gentleman” and will be deeply missed.
