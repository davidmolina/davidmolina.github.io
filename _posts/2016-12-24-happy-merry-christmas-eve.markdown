Happy Merry Christmas Eve from The Dalles, Oregon!

Departed Portland's madhouse traffic yesterday mid-day and beat I-205 and I-84 traffic after a quick stop at the Vancouver Westfield Mall for some Christmas shopping for the girls. Interstate 84 was clear, but visible snow throughout the Columbia Gorge, especially Hood River and The Dalles. Edith and the girls were already here.

This morning fired up the fireplace.

Honestly, it's my favorite part of the day. So far we've not cut any wood today (we have plenty), but tons of time playing Jenga with my girls. [Check out out my Snaps for some - @davidcmolina](https://www.snapchat.com/add/davidcmolina) and more from today. Drank up some tea & some Mexican-style eggs. 

My brother-in-law, Izzy, came out and we picked up some tables, Tequila Patron and start prepping his house for tonight.

So far, I've paired my iPhone bluetooth to his surround, [imported a ton of old Posterous blogs](https://github.com/davidmolina/davidmolina.github.io/commits/master), got my nephew Rivaldo setup on GitHub and downloading Cloud9 (he's 15), and taught my other nephew (his brother), Giovan, how to make a favorite Nayarit cocktail called "Cubas" that are very similar to Palomas. It's now 3:53 pm and we're kicking off the day w/ some caldo de camaron.

Wishing you an amazing Christmas eve and wishing Santa gets you everything you wish for.

Big hugs.
