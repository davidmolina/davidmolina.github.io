In this podcast, I interviewed Mrs. Mary Campos, a civil-service commissioner appointed by the Mayor of the City of Des Moines in Iowa, about careers in civil-service and public service. Campos explains that we must commit ourselves to improving the workforce diversity climate and that we must involve ourselves in the hard volunteer work at the city level. We hope this will inspire you about civil-service careers as it did for us. Greetings from Chicago.. Gracias, and happy listening!
