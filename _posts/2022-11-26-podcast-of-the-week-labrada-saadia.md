As some of you know I had to step away a few months ago, and reset. Some do it every Sunday, some annually on January 1st and others until you get tapped on the shoulder because they know better and want only the best for you. When Daniel Valdez introduced me to a few of his reads and podcasts that was helping him lose weight, build muscle, and become 1% better everyday I couldn’t understand it all at once. 

>> Inflammation has a way of distorting, fogging and blocking the connections in our brains to not run on all cylinders.

Over the years it has been frustrating but like a hamster on a flywheel or the frog that doesn’t know why he can’t climb a tree we get into an inertia that is nearly impossible to break unless we realize it it’s too late or someone comes along and shifts your paradigm.

In today’s podcast of the week is one of the Spanish-speaking doctors I got introduced over a year ago and a new one that has a parallel focus.

The takeaways:
- Taming the ego
- Industrialization of medicine
- Democratize lifestyle medicine
- Leadership medicine
- Mentor vs Protege, make more mentors
- Never stop being a kid

Here is that podcast:
