I presented the talk, "[When Happens When Military Veterans Learn to Code](http://codeconf.com/speakers/david-molina.html)," at [CodeConf](http://codeconf.com) LA this week. The full slides are available on [Speaker Deck in PDF](https://speakerdeck.com/davidmolina/what-happens-when-military-veterans-learn-to-code).

Summary: Learning to code is complicated. Between Googling your way and figuring it out on your own, military veterans now have a resource at the ready. Is it an open source project? Is it a community of military veterans learning to code? Is it a community of software developers that want to give back? A coding nonprofit? It's all of the above.

I will update this post when the YouTube goes up.

Special thanks to the GitHub team for their warm hospitality and giving me the opportunity to come talk before some of the brightest minds in the open source software community. It was an honor.
