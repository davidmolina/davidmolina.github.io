Today, I was interviewed on Latino Founder Hour by tech entrepreneur Edgar Navas over at NedSpace, Portland's original co-working space with some of the most amazing views around at the Union Bank of California Tower. Latino Founder Hour interviews Latino entrepreneurs from around the globe solving complicated problems and bringing them to life.

We talked about my upbringing as the son of migrant farmworkers, career trajectory, and why I started open source project [operationcode.org](https://operationcode.org/) after the Army.

The interview is in Spanish and runs a little under an hour. Hope you enjoy and look forward to your thoughts and feedback.
