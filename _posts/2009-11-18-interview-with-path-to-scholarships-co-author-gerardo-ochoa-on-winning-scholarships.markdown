In this interview, I sat down with Path to Scholarships co-author, Gerardo Ochoa, on what makes an award winning scholarship. Ochoa explains that, "you have to be able to tell your story in a way that demonstrates your human struggle, and what you are doing to be successful." His explanation of components for an award winning essay are excellent. Enjoy!
