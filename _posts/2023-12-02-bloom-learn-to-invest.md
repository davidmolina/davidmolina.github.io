When one of my twins, Citlali, mentioned this afternoon she wanted to learn how to invest, alongside [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/), [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/) and [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/), I thought about Bloom.

Bloom is an app that aims to teach teens and young adults how to invest in the stock market and grow their wealth.

Bloom offers over 200 interactive financial lessons, a real investing account, and various rewards and games to make learning and investing fun and engaging.

The onboarding process took sometime but after the install, approval process from both sides, and several emails with customer support Citlali will begin the week well into the race.

I've enjoyed watching my kids grow up with technology and gamification apps that make it fun to learn new skills and new languages. I look forward to learning alongside my youngest, trials and tribulations and update soon.
