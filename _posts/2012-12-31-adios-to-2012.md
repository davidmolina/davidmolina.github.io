This past year will go down personally as one of the most nurturing, rewarding and educational years.
- Our little family continued to grow.
- We conducted a few cross-country road trips, took a few Space-A military hops and became closer in the midst.
- It has also been a noble, humbling, and incredible second year serving in uniform at our nation's sacred ground at [Dover Air Force Base](https://www.dover.af.mil/).
- And, as some of you know it will also be my last. There is, however, an extraordinary team of Soldiers, Marines, Airmen, civilians, and contractors to continue the mission until the Afghanistan war ends in 2014.
- Personally fulfilling, it was also the year of hacking and learning code.
- I launched DoverCoders in partnership w/ a fellow programmer, Lawrence Wehle.
- Attended my first [AngelHack](https://angelhack.com/) Hackathon.
- Trained and hacked at several Meetups (Baltimore) and for the first time successfully pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/davidmolina/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for storing and production.
- I couldn't be more excited about learning and contributing to this craft.

Looking forward to returning to Portland and continuing to build [BilingualHire](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bilingualhire), grow a family, and contribute to our community.

Happy New Year, everyone!
