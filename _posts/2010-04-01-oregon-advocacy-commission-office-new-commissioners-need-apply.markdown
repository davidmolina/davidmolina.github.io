Opportunity To Serve Notice: The Oregon Advocacy Commission Office supports the work of 4 very important advocacy commissions: 1. The Commission on Asian Affairs, 2. The Commission on Black Affairs, 3. The Commission on Hispanic Affairs, and 4. The Commission for Women. These Commissions provide an important function of being a voice in state government and political arenas for some of the underserved populations in Oregon.  We need people who understand the importance of advocacy in these arenas to get active and serve.

[Disclaimer: I serve on the Commission on Hispanic Affairs.]

While each commission operates independently, following are some basics about the structure: 1. Each Commission has 11 members, 2. Commissioners are appointed by the Governor and Confirmed by the senate, 3. Appointments are for 3 year terms, and 4. Each commission meets between 6 and 12 times per year at various locations.

The next round of appointments occur in May this year. In order to be considered during this round of confirmations, your application must be submitted to Nancy Goss-Duran (contact info below) by April 15, 2010. POC:
