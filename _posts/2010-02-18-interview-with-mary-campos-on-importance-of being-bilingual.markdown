In this interview, Mrs. Mary Campos, a civil-service commissioner of Des Moines in Iowa, and I get into the importance of being bilingual. Campos explains that while it is important to master the English language, it is vitally important that we retain our second (or third, fourth) language. At [BilingualHire](http://bilingualhire.co), we couldn't agree more. Thanks Mrs. Campos for sharing your invaluable insight and thoughts for the current and future bilingual generation. Thanks, and happy listening!
