Portland is warming up fast. 72 here today. This morning on the way to work we saw a drone flying over the Forest Grove fields. I was driving so I couldn't tweet it. It was a pretty good size, small airplane-type, and led to a conversation with my wife, Edith, about good uses, from military operations to photographers and business uses. Out here, I immediately thought investors might be plotting growth.

Some emails later, I checked in on our Operation Code 501(c)(3) exempt application to the IRS. I was told I'd be waiting up to 180-days for a response, an approval or rejection. The IRS agent couldn't say more than that. I was amazed how her systems didn't give her real-time feed on who we were, Tweets, blogs, press coverage, leadership bios, etc. I was surprised, but not. Bureaucracy and red-tape at its finest. Welcome to the 21st century, right? However, crossing fingers that the [United States Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and/or [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) hook up with the IRS and help make American lives better.

Tried to submit an grant inquiry to the [Michael & Susan Dell Foundation](https://www.msdf.org/), but our EIN number failed. Not sure if it's their system, we need an intro, or it's my Safari browser. I put a note in and hope to hear back.

Got a call from Apple checking in our recent purchase. Yesterday, retired Sgt. First Class George Everts and I walked down to the Apple store and secured a MacBook Air and iPad mini 4. He's our incoming School Outreach Specialist (SOS) and will be helping on-board more code schools to accept the New GI Bill while conducting [briefings](https://github.com/OperationCode/tap-deck) at TAPs across the western United States.

As always, love to hear from you over on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/davidcmolina). To warmer days.
