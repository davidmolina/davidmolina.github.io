On Thursday evening, November 19th, the Oregon State University Chicano/Latino Alumni Association and El Centro Cultural Cesar Chavez will host the Dr. Manuel Pacheco Scholarship Reception with Chicano/Latino Alumni, Chicana/o and Latina/o student leaders (el Concilio) and faculty/staff to honor the late Pacheco, a philosophy professor who was instrumental in the creation of the Ethnic Studies Department, MEChA de OSU and development of Chicana/o student leaders. The reception will begin with recognizing last years Pacheco Scholarship recipients, Cristina Delgado and David Cortez. Since 2006, the OSU Chicano/Latino Alumni has awarded 6 book scholarships totaling $3,000, and membership efforts raised an equal amount towards an endowment. Secondly, we will be unveiling a scholarship plaque honoring the legacy of Pacheco and past recipients which will remain at el Centro. We will be fortunate to have former Pacheco and philosophy student, Willan Cervantes de Viru with us to provide some thoughts on the life and extraordinary talents of the late-Pacheco. Lastly, the board will be demonstrating the new Pacheco online scholarship application that will streamline the application process and expedite awards. Student leaders present will have the opportunity to be the first applicants, as the application will officially open.

Special thanks to Cristina Delgado, External Coordinator and staff at El Centro Cultural Cesar Chavez for their collaboration in this special reception.

See you @ el Centro!
--David
