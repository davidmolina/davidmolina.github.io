A little over a week ago during my trip to [GitHub Universe](http://githubuniverse.com/), my friend and rubyist mentor, [Chris Hough](https://twitter.com/chrishough), sent me a text to invite me to give a talk at Ruby on Rails PDX, a Portland meetup group where rails developers convene around the Ruby on Rails framework, building Rails Applications.

Yesterday, I gave [a talk](http://www.meetup.com/ruby-on-rails-pdx/events/229623727/) on [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/), from background & history to lessons learned building an open source military veterans community (and nonprofit) and technologies we use.

One of the questions raised that was interesting:
(1) Transition Assistance Program - The answer is yes. It's been on our radar since our founding. Our Chief of Staff/Operations, Conrad Hollomon, met with senior Pentagon officials over the summer to discuss and coordinate how to be included as a resource in all TAP decks.

A picture from last night:
