Sunday, I had the joy of taking my toddler, Maya, to visit the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) located just off the banks of Portland's Willamette River. Aside from an afternoon of stimulating centers, the array of games and toys, child sandboxes, water pools, gravity and light fixtures, I was very happy to see the cafe's final resting stop for our snack and mid-afternoon meals. The #OMSI cafe has three choices: paper, plastic and scrap (roughly). No trash section. It forced Maya and I to spend a couple of seconds to separate and be part of recycling, reusing, and rethinking new ways. Do you think a toddler will remember? Where else should I take Maya to learn new ways?
