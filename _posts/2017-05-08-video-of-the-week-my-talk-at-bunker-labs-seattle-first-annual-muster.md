Last Friday afternoon, I went to [Bunker Labs Seattle](https://bunkerlabs.org/seattle/) for their first annual muster and spoke for about 15mins.

Those remarks are below.

I spoke on the [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/) mission, how we formed, why learning to code is imperative for veteran founders, building an MVP and never giving up on building a company. Bunker Labs is a national non-profit created by military veterans for veterans to start and grow businesses.

Could not be more excited to have a new Seattle chapter here in the bustling Pacific Northwest region.
