I'm setting up a Posterous account after reading Jason Calacanis's Posterous page. And after browsing the different people (Sacca, Chris Brogan, etc) who have Posterous I came to realize that this is a website made simple. While I blog at [bilingualhireco.com](http://bilingualhire.co) on company news, career insights and the future of bilingual [Spanish+ English] talent, [molina.posterous.com](https://www.davidcmolina.com/) will add to the conversation. Shall we?
