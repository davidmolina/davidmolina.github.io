For years I've suffered from lack of sleep. I imagined it was because I worked too hard, ate too close to going to bed, or over drank. The truth was twofold: being overweight and not getting regenerative sleep. While I've never been diagnosed by the VA with sleep apnea, I've been known to snore in my sleep and wake others up at the detriment of my relationships. One way to resolve sleep apnea is in fact losing excessive weight.

Over the last year in my lifestyle medicine masterclass I've been intentional about losing weight, eliminating processed foods in my nutrition, eliminating medication and sugary drinks. Over the weekend at my oldest quinceÃ±era my brother Victor told us about something he'd discovered and it was working wonders on his sleep. It's a simple hack requiring little or no effort at all.

The answer: turning your phone on airplane mode while you sleep and storing it at least an arms length away.

Steps on iPhone:
```javascript
- Settings >
- Airplane Mode > turn on
- Place arms length away and go to sleep
```

Our bodies and brains are electrical and that by shutting off all electromagnetic waves, our brains are able to rest.

I'm going to try this hack and will update you.
