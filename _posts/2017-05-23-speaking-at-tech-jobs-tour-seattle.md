This Wednesday afternoon, [I'll be speaking](https://techjobstour.com/speakers/dave-molina/) at [Tech Jobs Tour Seattle](https://techjobstour.com/tour-stops/seattle/) during the evening and probably before the 3rd Chief Technology Officer of the United States of America Megan Smith. I don't know the order, but it's this Wednesday along an amazing array of founders, entrepreneurs and software engineers, and many others.

Anyone can register for free [here on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tech-jobs-tour-seattle-special-guest-megan-smith-3rd-cto-us-career-fair-speed-mentoring-tickets-33092943886).
