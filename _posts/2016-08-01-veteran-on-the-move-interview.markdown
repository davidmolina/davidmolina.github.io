As promised yesterday, podcast interview went live today. As it happens, a few weeks ago Rob Kriner, an [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org) marketing/communications volunteer introduced us to Joe Crane, a 24 year Military Veteran and the founder and host of the Veteran on the Move podcast. As Joe puts it:

>Veteran on the Move is your pathfinder to freedom, guiding veterans in their transition to entrepreneurship. I interview today’s most influential people in the world of entrepreneurship."

>Veteran On The Move is all about promoting the ideas, tools and resources available to today’s entrepreneurs.  We want to help you find the tools and resources needed to start your own entrepreneurial journey.

It's a little over 30 minutes long.
