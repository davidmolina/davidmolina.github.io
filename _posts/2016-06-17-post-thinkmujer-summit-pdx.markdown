Like anyone that attended this year's ThinkMujer Summit at the University of Portland, I was impressed and in awe that 200 Latina professionals, bilingual and bicultural could be assembled in one place. More than anything I was impressed by the cohesive team that helped put it together, from University of Portland students to Latina leaders in the community. The summit opened with opening remarks, "we need more people, more diverse points of views at the seat of the table." This was a powerful reminder to everyone why we do what we do.

The lineup included, nonprofit executive directors and senior staff. Between the questions and answers, it could be distilled into, "have a ton of passion and love for this, because it's not your regular day job." Yazmin Bramila of Casa Latinos Unidos de Benton County, argued, "have conviction in your beliefs even when support is limited."

During the summit, Edith, presented State Rep. Candidate Teresa Alonso a check for $500. A reminder that as small business owners we must support candidates that promote good policy for the common good.

The Jefas panel included family friend, Isabel Sanchez, co-owner of Churros Locos. Her story was amazing in that, we should be proud of our culture and share it with the world.

Bauccio Commons provided the perfect setting, warm, intimate and beautiful views of Portland. I'm so thrilled the ThinkMujer Summit is coming to Seattle, Washington next. Save the date for October 28th, and check out ThinkMujer's Facebook for photos of the event: [facebook.com/thinkmujer](https://facebook.com/thinkmujer).
