Today, our familia celebrates the 4th. Family from The Dalles to friends from Stockton, and Portland, we enjoy some cold ones, carne asada, salsa picante, BBQ ribs (thanks Brito for the homemade BBQ sauce!) and beautiful memories. In the end that's what its about. Salud, and Happy 4th! Oh, and if you're in the Portland area stop by and say hi.
