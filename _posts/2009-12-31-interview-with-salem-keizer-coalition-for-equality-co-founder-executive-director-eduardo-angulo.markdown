In this podcast interview, I sat down with Salem-OR based Salem/Keizer Coalition for Equality Co-Founder and Executive Director, Eduardo Angulo, on non-profit careers in education and youth empowerment. Angulo explains that you have to have passion and a lot of heart going in. Enjoy! Thanks for listening! More on [SKCE](http://www.skcequality.org). (NOTE: Our apologies to Eduardo on the background feedback. Next time, no smart phones allowed in the room).
