Over the past three years I've transitioned from prescriptive medicine to lifestyle medicine, one in which health is the foundation of living. This has resulted in losing over 77lbs, healthy blood work, shrinking shirt and pant size, including blazers, and no longer out of breath when participating in normal or incline activities. As some of you already know, I blanked out driving my dually fully loaded over the Portland St. John's bridge in summer 2022. That near life experience changed my perspective about entrepreneurship and hustle. 

Back in the day, I would work endlessly burning the midnight oil, popping sugary drinks just to wake up, fire up the work truck and hit the nearby convenience store for a coffee and a few pumps of french vanilla, a donut, followed by a morning or midday lunch, pop, afternoon beers, endless emotional eating, endless sedentary hours in the office, coupled with lack of sleep, pills for pain and it caught up. Badly. But what good is it to always live to work, instead of work to live? What good is it to work endlessly, if your accelerating time decay and aging faster-- or worse, your quality of life the last half sucks? I wrote about a few habits that I implemented a few months after [here](/2023/10/25/the-power-of-a-lymphatic-drainage-massage/), but this week I visited an ailing uncle who's not sick because of habits, but due to a bad step fall. This is a person that's always been physically strong, a surveyor embedded on major infrastructure projects, but now is aging faster.

In my [healing journey](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNIzp7Exonk/?img_index=1), I've done these to slow aging, reduce inflammation, and naturally help the body heal with nature's best. 

**Morning**
- A glass of warm water with lemon squeeze and a pinch of cayenne pepper. The lemon activates the liver, is anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory. The cayenne pepper is like fielding a medical doctor in your system and attacks internal injuries that you don't see and increases blood flow.
- A cup of ginger tea which is a major healing veggie that is anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory. Chew on the remaining pieces in the tea.

**Afternoon** 
- A cup of chamomile tea in the afternoon to help relax and sooth the body. 

**Night**
- A cup of milk turmeric tea with a pinch of fresh black pepper. This tea is calming and puts most anyone to sleep within the hour. 
- Massage magnesium spray, a powerful mineral spray on chest, stomach and calf leg. It causes 300 chain reactions in our bodies that often don't communicate, absorb vitamins, and healing properties from food. The calf is also known as our secondary heart.

When we know better, we must do better.
