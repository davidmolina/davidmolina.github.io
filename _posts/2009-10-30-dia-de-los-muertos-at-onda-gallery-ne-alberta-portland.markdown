In honor of our familias and friends that have passed on to the other side, altars adorned with their favorite tequila and favorite dish, we celebrate their life. This year we visited Onda Gallery located on NE Alberta, home of the "Last Thursday." There was music, tequila, pan de muerto, and artista galore. Dia de los Muertos is a pre-Hispanic celebration where we honor the fallen. Where we pay our respects. Where we remember their laughs, lives and contributions to nuestros corazones. Where we remember the past and honor the present. Salud!
