Happy New Year Everyone.

Arrived late this evening from a weekend in Mount Vernon, Washington ([Skagit Valley](https://twitter.com/search?q=skagitvalley)) visiting mom, sisters, nephews and nieces. As is typical with small children we usually make several stops along the way up from Portland, usually around the JBLM and Seattle area.

We left mid-day Friday and stopped for dinner at an Italian place in Seattle with [Fernando Paredes](https://twitter.com/nanoxd) and his beautiful family. It was a relaxing evening catching up over lasagna and pizza and we ended up staying one night in their lovely home (we previously stayed when Edith and I were up in Seattle for the [GeekWire Awards](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina/status/730964354821038080)) over the summer.

The next morning Fernando and I took a walk along the waterfront and talked SSH keys, family, [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/) and careers. I whipped up some french toast w/ fresh strawberries & powdered sugar for the kids and prepped the chilaquiles (Edith finished them off and killed it).

Our kids played all morning and afternoon before we departed the last hour in our trek to ring in the new year at mom's (posted plenty on Instagram/Snapchat). The roads were clear for the most part there and back.

Exhausting weekend, but very stoked to be back in Portland. Cheers and here's to another kickass year.
