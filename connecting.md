The best way to follow what I'm up to:
- [Snapchat - @davidcmolina](https://snapchat.com/add/davidcmolina), unfiltered daily activities. 
- [Instagram - @davidcmolina](https://www.instagram.com/davidcmolina/), I share tips, lessons learned and best practices in my field. 

My time is limited on these networks:
- [LinkedIn - @davidcmolina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcmolina/), mostly a resume online and a few times repost interesting knowledge.  
- [Facebook - /david.molina1](https://www.facebook.com/david.molina1), unless we know each other I rarely accept friend requests. Keep it to family, friends and prior military colleagues. It is a public profile though and welcome to follow. 
- [GitHub - @davidmolina](https://github.com/davidmolina/), this is where most of my open source contributions and blog code is stored. 

Due to pressing demands, I'm not currently as active on:
- [Twitter - @davidcmolina](https://twitter.com/davidcmolina)
- [Medium - @davidcmolina](https://medium.com/@davidcmolina)
- [Foursquare - @davidcmolina](https://foursquare.com/davidcmolina)
- [Flickr - @davidcmolina](https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidcmolina/)
- [Tumblr - @davidcmolina](https://davidcmolina.tumblr.com/)
- [about.me - @molina](https://about.me/molina)
