Captain U.S. Army) is Founder of Operation Code and self-taught writing the first line of code to petition Congress to expand the New GI Bill to include coding schools, a benefit he couldn’t use after exiting after 12 years in uniform. An entrepreneur, David has built numerous startups, has testified before members of Congress to expand technical education for veterans and spouses, and as a former captain in the Army was recipient of the Lt. Rowan Award, Meritorious Service Medal and Army Commendation Medal.

January 17, 2018, [Hacking Entrepreneurship — An Interview with David Molina of Operation Code](https://medium.com/the-hum/hacking-entrepreneurship-an-interview-with-david-molina-of-operation-code-12a7e199e4e0) — When you hear the word entrepreneurship, it is natural to think of venture capitalists, unicorn companies, and startup founders driven to make a profit above all else. With that in mind, you might call Operation Code an unconventional tech startup and David Molina an unconventional entrepreneur. But he and his company’s impact is reaching as far as any of the tech companies turning out billions. And their purpose is far greater as well.

November 17, 2017, [Oregon Veterans News Magazine: Code Warriors](https://operationcode.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/veterans_news_magazine_nov2017.pdf) [PDF Download] — “Coding is the new literacy of the 21st century,” Molina says. “The blue collar jobs used to be laying pipe and wire and building the infrastructure of the country; now, it’s connecting the wires and plumbing of the internet.”

July 3, 2017, [Operation Code: Connecting Veterans with Code Skills
](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/operation-code-connecting-veterans-with-code) — Operation Code started when its founder, former Army Captain David Molina, realized he couldn’t apply his New GI Bill to go to a code school. Though military veterans can use their GI bills for college and vocational schools, it’s very difficult to apply this funding to code schools. Molina was troubled to find that technical education was so difficult for veterans to access, and that they weren’t pursuing technical skills due to a combination of limited exposure, lack of funds, and misconceptions about what credentials are needed. So he started working on a way to change that.

June 16, 2017, [Sabio Stories](https://soundcloud.com/wesabio/davemolina) — Operation Code Founder and Sabio friend and partner Dave Molina talks to us about transitioning into coding from Army life, the work he's done to create more opportunities for veterans to code, and why he loves working with Sabio.

Veterans and family members, pursuing a variety of ventures, have begun gathering in a community office space near Union Station.

May 30, 2017, [USA Today:](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/05/30/heres-what-you-need-land-americas-best-jobs/101730006/) — The nation's best jobs boast salaries that average $100,000 and up, offer generous company benefits, and promise to have recruiting suitors fighting for your hand. But they are highly technical roles carrying job descriptions like DevOps engineer and analytics manager that demand an alphabet soup of computer skills as well as incessant on-the-job learning. So do you have to be a math genius with a spare PhD in physics to get one of these great gigs? What we found might surprise you.

No luck. Though the GI Bill applies to public universities and some for-profit colleges, he couldn’t get approval to use funds for intensive coding schools, often called boot camps.

June 7, 2016, [Mentoring Developers: How to pick a programming language to learn for new developers – Part 2](http://mentoringdevelopers.com/episode-36-how-to-pick-a-programming-language-to-learn-for-new-developers-part-2/) - When you are new to software development, there is always the challenge of determining which of the many software or framework programs you should learn first.

I signed up for "One Month Rails," and the community immediately removed my anxiety, because everyone was there to learn and share. I learned about Ruby, AWS, Heroku, navigating the command line and debugging code by Googling it.

March 20, 2016, [Software Engineering Daily: More and more veterans who leave the army are becoming coders, and the mission of Operation Code is to help veterans make that transition](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/03/20/helping-veterans-learn-code-david-molina/) - Military veterans have the right set of skills to become programmers.

But he was disappointed to learn that the G.I. Bill wouldn’t enable him to attend a code bootcamp — which he saw as his ticket to that tech career. “The Army’s Soldier for Life Program that is intended to help separating soldiers transition into new careers didn’t offer much career-specific guidance on the software developer field.  Most information related to computers or technology was centered around network admin or network security,” Hampton said.

November 8, 2015, [International Business Times: Coding boot camps go after veterans to take Silicon Valley's vacant tech jobs](http://www.ibtimes.com/coding-boot-camps-go-after-veterans-take-silicon-valleys-vacant-tech-jobs-2174421) - When John Hampton was honorably discharged from the Army this year, he decided to pursue a lifelong interest: coding.

He found many, including a couple in Central Oregon, and he’s about to launch Operation Code, a Portland-based nonprofit that will give veterans scholarships for code school and help them find jobs in computing.

November 11, 2014, [Switchup: Why veterans will make excellent programmers: when we can use the New GI Bill](https://www.switchup.org/blog/why-veterans-will-make-excellent-programmers) - Veterans are excellent candidates for becoming coders. Military training teaches soldiers how to be highly disciplined, pay close attention to detail, persevere through difficult circumstances, and work on a team. These learned traits can be great assets for someone working in the web development field. For veterans who are looking for a well-paying and in-demand career, there are few industries as appealing as programming. The government reports there were 722,000 unemployed veterans in 2013 while it projects over one million unfilled programming positions by 2020. The economy's need for programming talent can be partly filled by retraining veterans who have finished their military service.
