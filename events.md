- [CodeConf LA](http://codeconf.com) - *June 27-29, 2016, Los Angeles*. My [talk](http://codeconf.com/speakers/david-molina.html) is titled, "What Happens When Military Veterans Learn to Code." Description: Learning to code is complicated. Between Googling your way and figuring it out on your own, military veterans now have a resource at the ready. Is it an open source project? Is it a community of military veterans learning to code? Is it a community of software developers that want to give back? A coding nonprofit? It's all of the above. Read the [blog recap](https://github.com/blog/2207-codeconf-la-recap-special-thanks) and [storify](https://github.com/blog/2207-codeconf-la-recap-special-thanks).

Keynote speaker at the OSP Veterans' Association April meeting on what we do at [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org). I was honored and humbled at the opportunity and immense interest of so many incarcerated vets to learn to code and build software to change the world. One vet told me he used to code in Pascal. Pascal! Majority veterans I spoke with were interested in coding to build useful skills so as to not return.
