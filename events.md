## Presentation, talks, conferences.

# Upcoming
- [CodeConf LA](http://codeconf.com) - *June 27-29, 2016, Los Angeles*. My talk is titled, "What Happens When Military Veterans Learn to Code." Description: Learning to code is complicated. Between Googling your way and figuring it out on your own, military veterans now have a resource at the ready. Is it an open source project? Is it a community of military veterans learning to code? Is it a community of software developers that want to give back? A coding nonprofit? It's all of the above.

I was honored and humbled at the opportunity and immense interest of so many incarcerated vets to learn to code and build software. One vet told me he used to code in Pascal. Pascal! Majority veterans I spoke with were interested in coding to build useful skills.
